# NGOEnlist

This is a project built for the MongoDB coursework. This is built using Ejs as a frontend template and Nodejs as the backend. MongoDB is used to store and fetch the data. I have used multer to upload the images and create a new dataset.

MongoDB has one amazing feature called search query using geolocation which I used in this application. It is used to extract not only the nearby location but also searches by name/query which is made using regex.
