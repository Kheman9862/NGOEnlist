# NGOEnlist

This is a project built for the MongoDB coursework. This is built using Ejs as a frontend template and Nodejs as the backend. Mongodb is used to store and fetch the data. I have used multer to upload the images and create a new dataset.

Mongodb has one amazing feature called serach query using geolocation which i used in this application. It is used to ectract not only the nearby location but also search by name/query which is made using regex.
